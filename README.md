# Go Falling Sand

This very simple project is used as a personal introduction to Golang. The project is about a falling sand simulator made with the Ebiten library. 
The project is based in the [Coding Train Falling Sand Code Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4u7Zy_b868&t=1162s&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) video:
